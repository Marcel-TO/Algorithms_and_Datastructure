# Befunge Interpreter

## Task

Write an **interpreter** for the esoteric language **Befunge-93**. The interpreter must accept valid Befunge-93 programs, handle user input and print output.

> **Befunge** is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid.
> "Arrow" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle.

## Bonus Tasks
- Visualize the execution of the program
- Let the user step through individual steps
- Display the contents of the current stack
- Allow interactive editing of the program
